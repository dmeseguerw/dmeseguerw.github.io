Welcome to this mini-project. We will work with the SF Crime Data to present a short data-story on how the use of alcohol and drugs have impacted the different districts in SF. Showing timelines, heatmaps, correlation between features, frequent days/hours, etc...

Let's use calendar plots, a heatmap to plot the distribution during time per district, and something else as an interactive viz.

# Simple calendar plot for crimes per day

Analyzing the following calendar plot for the focused crimes per each day available in the dataset leads us to easily detect some interesting patterns. 

* First, a peak in these crimes is easily observed during the years 2008 and 2009. This can be attributed to the economic crisis that the United States was sustaining during these years, resulting in an increase of alcohol and drug usage.

* A decline in the years following 2010 is observed, more to be added...

* Highest rates are always during the first and last three months of the year. Could there be an indicator on why the middle of the year has a lower probability of crime ocurrence? Maybe something related to winter's harsh conditions can potentiate the use of drugs and alcohol?
